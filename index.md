## ABOUT ME

My name is Ha Le and I'm a third year PhD student in Computer Science at Northeastern University. My research areas are HCI and Ubiquitous and Wearables Computing. Particularly, I worked on multimodal data annotation interfaces for human activity and behavioral recognition. I combined different device form factors, input modalities and sensors to design software that empower people to monitor their data and train their own machine learning models.

I received my Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Gustavus Adolphus College in 2022. During my 4 years at Gustavus, I did research under the supervision of Prof. Louis Yu, Jillian Downey and Jacob Siehler.
